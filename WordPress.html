        <h2>33 Best Multipurpose WordPress Themes 2023</h2>
        <p>Recently, I experimented: Can I use multipurpose WordPress themes for multiple clients’ websites? (Without them knowing.)</p>
        <p>Conclusion? You BET I can! And so can YOU.</p>
        <p>For this, I investigated 100s of themes and chose a list of 33 based on the number of available demos, how many industries they fit, and advanced customizations.</p>
        <p>WHY SO MANY? Because these truly cover everything: brands, companies, agencies, freelancers, bloggers, organizations, corporations, etc.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I also looked if they have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser & device compatibility</li>
            <li>Features to promote products & services</li>
            <li>Option to <a href="">create a professional portfolio</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Social media integration</a></li>
            <li>eCommerce support</li>
            <li>Responsive and mobile-friendly design</li>
            <li>Drag and drop website builder</li>
            <li>Plenty of starter templates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don’t need to buy a new WordPress theme for every new project you work on. These multipurpose themes are big money and time savers.</p>
        <p>Ready to BOOST your workflow?</p>
